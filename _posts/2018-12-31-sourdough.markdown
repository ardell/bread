Ingredients
-----------

| Ingredient                    | Weight (grams) |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| King Arthur Bread Flour       |            360 |
| Filtered water                |            144 |
| Kosher salt                   |             25 |
| Sourdough Starter *           |            722 |
|------------------------------------------------|

\* Ischia Island (Italy) sourdough starter at 100% hydration

Total hydration: (144+(722/2))/(360+(722/2)) = 70.0%

Total salt content: 25/(360+(722/2)) = 3.5% (Note: this is a different way
of calculating salt percentage than I've used in previous recipes, but it is
equivalent to 4.6% salt content from the 12/25 recipe)

Process
-------

Feed starter and allow to ferment at room temperature until it forms lots of
decent-sized bubbles.

Mix all ingredients and stir with a spoon until combined (but do not knead).

Transfer to a container with top, cover, and allow to rise at room temperature
for 4 hours. Transfer to refrigerator and allow to ferment another 9 hours.
Remove from refrigerator and allow to rise at room temperature for another 4
hours. Return to refrigerator and allow to rise another 22 hours. Remove from
refrigerator and allow to come up to room temperature for 90 minutes.

Preheat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit with a cast iron skillet on top of a
baking stone on the bottom rack.

Flour work surface. Add lots of flour if needed to form a workable dough.
Flour both the dough and banneton generously, place dough in banneton and
cover. Allow to proof until they pass the poke test--around 30-60 minutes.

Transfer loaf from banneton to parchment paper. Flour the top of the loaves
and score with a sharp knife at a 30 degree angle.

Place loaves and parchment paper in hot cast iron skillet, spray with filtered
water, place top (an inverted stock pot works well) on skillet, and spray sides
of oven with water. Close oven door immediately.

Bake with top on the cast iron skillet for the first 40 minutes, then drop oven
temperature to 410, remove top, turn 180 degrees and spray top of loaf and
sides of oven again with filtered water. Close oven door immediately.

After internal temperature reaches 207 degrees Fahrenheit, increase temperature
to 475 dgrees Fahrenheit and bake for another 5 minutes. Loaf should reach a
final internal temperature of 211 degrees Fahrenheit.

Rest on a wire rack for at least two hours before cutting.

Notes
------

Salt content was good.

Loaf wasn't particularly sour, but was a bit yeastier than previous loaves.

Oven spring was good.

Crust was good--more time spent covered seems to make a thinner, crispier
crust.

Crumb was better--had a softer feel than past loaves that were all bread flour.
Could still stand to be a little softer, so maybe increase the bread flour
content further.

Upcoming experiments
--------------------

Try autolysing for 2 hours before adding yeast or salt to improve texture and
open up the crumb a bit more.

Try leaving the bread covered a bit longer in the oven to get a really thin and
crispy crust (as opposed to a rustic, crusty crust).

Try increasing all purpose flour content.

Try scoring a little less deeply to improve the shape.

Try using some rye or whole wheat flour to improve the flavor.

Consider trying the [Tangzhong technique](https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2018/07/23/how-to-convert-a-bread-recipe-to-tangzhong/)
to increase hydration of the bread.

Consider using a proofing bag to keep more humidity in during proofing.

Try baking in a real cast iron dutch oven.

Consider making the dough a bit drier for the bulk fermentation stage. Some
articles mention that a drier starter makes a more sour bread. Might extend to
the bulk fermentation phase as well. This bread was 70.0+% hydration during
bulk ferment; maybe try to get below 68% (or lower) and see how it goes.
