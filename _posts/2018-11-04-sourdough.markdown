| Ingredient              | Weight (grams) | Baker's Percentage |
|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| King Arthur Bread Flour |            457 |             100.0% |
| Filtered water          |            276 |              60.4% |
| Kosher salt             |             10 |               2.2% |

|---------------------------------------------------------------|

\* Ischia Island (Italy) sourdough starter at 100% hydration

Total hydration: (276+(300/2))/(457+(300/2)) = 70.2%

Process
-------

Feed starter and allow to ferment at 85.0 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 hours. I use
a sous vide circulator to maintain temperature while fermenting starter.

Mix 400 grams of flour and all of the water until combined, cover, and rest
(autolyse) for 30 minutes.

Add salt and sourdough starter. Knead by hand for 12 minutes. Add more flour (I
added 57 grams) to form a stable, but somewhat wet dough.

Transfer to a lightly olive-oiled container with top, cover, refrigerate, and
bulk ferment for ~1.5 days (until dough smells sweet and nutty, but before it
forms large bubbles on the top.

Remove dough from refrigerator and allow it to warm up at room temperature for
4 hours.

Preheat oven to 410 degrees Fahrenheit with a cast iron skillet on the bottom
rack.

Flour work surface. Fold dough into thirds 4 times. Add flour if needed to form
a firm dough. Shape dough into a round, and place seam-side-down on parchment
paper, cover with a large bowl, and proof at 72 degrees Fahrenheit until dough
passes the poke test (about another hour and 20 minutes).

Flour the top of the loaf and score with a sharp knife at a 30 degree angle.

Place loaf and parchment paper in hot cast iron skillet, spray with filtered
water, place top on skillet, and spray sides of oven with water. Close oven
door immediately.

Bake with top on the cast iron skillet for the first 20 minutes, then remove
top and spray top of loaf and sides of oven again with filtered water. Close
oven door immediately.

When internal temperature reaches 205 degrees Fahrenheit, turn oven temperature
to 475 degrees Fahrenheit. Bake for a few minutes longer to brown the crust.

Notes
------

Starter may have been a little dormant compared to usual before kneading.
Usually it has decent size bubbles and smells quite sour but due to the short
time in the sous vide circulator it may not have been fully active.

Oven spring was quite good.

Crumb was a little tougher than I'd like. This could be due to either using
some rye flour in the starter or too much kneading.

Crust could've been a little deeper brown and a little crispier. Crumb was
good--soft, not gummy with decently large bubbles near the top. I think doing
less bulk fermentation and more proofing was a good decision.

After bulk fermentation the dough only had a minimal number of bubbles. This
seems to be linked to the lower activity of the starter. This seemed to leave
more sugars/starches for the yeast to consume during proofing/baking, leading
to larger oven spring.

Upcoming experiments
--------------------

Consider making the dough a bit drier for the bulk fermentation stage. Some
articles mention that a drier starter makes a more sour bread. Might extend to
the bulk fermentation phase as well. This bread was (275+150)/(444+150)=71.5+%
hydration during bulk ferment; maybe try to get below 68% (or lower) and see
how it goes.

Consider using a banneton without liner for improved shape.

Consider turning on convection bake (and turning oven temp to 450 degrees
Fahrenheit) earlier, maybe when internal temperature is 185 or 190 degrees
Fahrenheit. Also consider leaving loaf in the oven for ~5 minutes after it
reaches 194 degrees Fahrenheit.

Consider letting the bread bake to a hotter internal temp (206-209 degrees
Fahrenheit) to make the crumb a little drier/less tough/fluffier.

Consider kneading less before, and folding less after bulk fermentation.
