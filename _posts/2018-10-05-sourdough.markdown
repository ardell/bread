\* Ischia Island (Italy) sourdough starter at 100% hydration

Process
-------

Feed starter and allow to ferment at 77.4 degrees Fahrenheit for 6 hours. I use
a sous vide circulator to maintain temperature while fermenting starter.

Mix 400 grams of flour and all of the water until combined, cover, and rest
(autolyse) for 40 minutes.

Add salt and sourdough starter. Mix using Kitchen Aid mixer with dough hook on
the lowest speed for 12 minutes. Add more flour (I added 44 grams) to form a
stable, but rather wet dough.

Transfer to a lightly olive-oiled container with top, cover, and bulk ferment
for 3 hours at approximately 70 degrees Fahrenheit.

Transfer to refrigerator (37 degrees Fahrenheit) and ferment for an additional
19 hours.

Remove dough from refrigerator and allow it to warm up at room temperature for
1 hour.

Flour work surface. Fold dough into thirds 5 times. Add flour if needed to form
a firm dough.

Preheat oven to 410 degrees Fahrenheit with a cast iron skillet on the bottom
rack.

Shape dough into a round, and place seam-side-up in banneton. Wrap banneton in
plastic wrap and allow to proof at 68 degrees Fahrenheit until dough passes the
poke test (about another hour and 20 minutes).

Turn dough out of banneton, onto parchment paper. Flour the top of the loaf and
score with a razor blade at a 30 degree angle.

Place loaf and parchment paper in hot cast iron skillet, spray with filtered
water, place top on skillet, and spray sides of oven with water. Close oven
door immediately.

Bake with top on the cast iron skillet for the first 20 minutes, then remove
top and spray top of loaf and sides of oven again with filtered water. Close
oven door immediately.

When internal temperature reaches 192 degrees Fahrenheit, turn oven temperature
to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and turn on convection bake cycle. Bake until
internal temperature reaches 194 degrees, approximately 25 minutes after
removing the top from the cast iron skillet. (NOTE: this temperature is much
lower than normal since I'm baking at an elevation of ~8700 feet)

Notes
------

Dough was a good consistency after bulk fermentation, and required only a
little more than standard bench flour to work.

Dough wasn't particularly stretchy after bulk fermentation, and required
resting for a few minutes to perform the last two stretch/folds.

Bottom of loaf sounded nice and hollow immediately after removing from oven.

Oven spring was good, but could be better.

Salt content was great.

Crumb and crust were great. Crumb was slightly moist and crust was perfectly
crispy but could have been a little darker.

Very little sour flavor.

Upcoming experiments
--------------------

Consider bulk fermenting the dough for several days in the refrigerator to try
to develop a much more sour flavor.

Consider making the dough a bit drier for the bulk fermentation stage. Some
articles mention that a drier starter makes a more sour bread. Might extend to
the bulk fermentation phase as well. This bread was (275+150)/(444+150)=71.5+%
hydration during bulk ferment; maybe try to get below 68% (or lower) and see
how it goes.

Consider using a banneton without liner for improved shape.

Consider turning on convection bake (and turning oven temp to 450 degrees
Fahrenheit) earlier, maybe when internal temperature is 185 or 190 degrees
Fahrenheit. Also consider leaving loaf in the oven for ~5 minutes after it
reaches 194 degrees Fahrenheit.

Consider scoring in two parallel lines down the middle, with "ears" pointing
inward (angle blade 30 degrees inward on each score). Also consider scoring
more deeply.
